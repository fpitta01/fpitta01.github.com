Assignment 1 - Comp 20
Francesco Pittaluga

All aspects of the assignment have been correctly implemented. Index.html, bio.html and 
resume.html were created and saved into my github account's special repository. Two CSS
stylesheets, mobile.css and desktop.css, were also created and uploaded to a folder in 
my special repository called stylesheets. Index.html includes a picture of myself,
a link to my bio, a link to my resume and my name. Bio.html includes a short biography 
of myself. Resume.html includes all of the data specified in the comp 20 assignment 1 
description.

I collaborated briefly with Nicholas Davis on this assignment.

I spent approximately 8 hours competing this assignment.
