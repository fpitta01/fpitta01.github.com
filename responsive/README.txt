Lab 3 - Comp 20 
Francesco Pittaluga

All aspects of the Lab were implemented correctly. When a device with a
resolution <= 1136px (<= 1136 was chosen to work well with an iphone 5) loads
http://fpitta01.github.com/responsive with a browser the word "Dice" is
rendered on the screen. When the page is loaded on a screen with a resolution >=
1137px (>= 1137 was chosen to work well on a traditional desktop or laptop) the
browser renders the words "No Dice" on the screen.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this lab.

I spent approximately one hour on this lab.
